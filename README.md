# FundProgramming
There are fundamental structures in a program no matter what the programming language is. The programming paradigm determines of course the complement of program structures present be it procedural, declarative, object-oriented or otherwise; and the manner in which the structures come together to make a computer program.

I have always thought about the insights I gained when considering such commonalities of languages obscured by focusing only on the  code and syntax. I believe much can be gained considering in a general way the programming constructs beneath the specifics of syntax for the languages and the programming paradigms. It is very much like studying (English) Literature compared to simply reading a novel.			   
			
I am now putting those ideas together to look at programming beyond the syntax into a MOOC for Udemy which I hope will make us all better and more conscious programmers while providing a discussion catalyst for those relatively new to solving problems with computers.
