# FundProgramming
There are fundamental structures in a program no matter what the programming language is. The programming paradigm determines of course the complement of program structure present be it procedural, prescriptive object-oriented or otherise ane the manner in which the structures come together to make a computer program.

There is I believe value to looking at programming from the prespective of the fundamental structures which make up the code without the dressing of any particular language or dialect. With this in mind, this project is intended to develop a course providing a generic handling of the approaches to coding a program through these fundamental structures. The trappings of the specifics of syntax then are added secondarily having emphasized how the languages are alike and/or different underneath the syntax.
